# Salesforce App

This guide helps Salesforce developers who are new to Visual Studio Code go from zero to a deployed app using Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI.
This project was created with the analytics template which is configured to work with Einstein Analytics features.

## Pre-requisite:
1. User should have an Winter'21 Dev-Hub org. [Winter'21 Pre-release org](https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/prerelease-winter21/)
2. If the user is going with below Option 1, then the Salesforce CLI along with VS Code should be installed in your system. If not installed, then follow instructions given in the [Set Up Your Workspace and Install Developer Tools](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-vscode-salesforce/vscode-salesforce-ready?trail_id=set-up-your-workspace-and-install-developer-tools) trailhead.

## How to setup org with this project? 

### Option 1(Recommended for testing on scratch org) - For installation using VS code on scratch org.
1. [Download repo](https://github.com/ashishshukla38/AnlyTxEAHackathon/archive/master.zip) or Clone this repo locally: -- git clone https://github.com/ashishshukla38/AnlyTxEAHackathon.git 
2. Open AnlyTxEAHackathon folder inside VS Code and set the current user as Dev hub user.
3. Run init.sh -- ./init.sh - 
    This shell file will create an scratch org, will install AnlyTx app and open the newly created org in new browser tab.
